			<h2>Instructions</h2>

			<p>Hi there! I'm glad you're interested in our developer internship here at New Kind. It wasn't <em>that</em> long ago that I was in your shoes, eager to break into the web-world.</p>

			<p>It's my goal for our intern to learn a ton of practical, real-world skills and knowledge, so that you're ready to step right into a developer role either here at New Kind, or wherever it is you'd like to go in the world.</p>

			<p>Let's start learning now! I'm going to need you to go fork this repo on github to submit your response. Don't know how to do that yet? That's ok! This industry is full of learning every day, and your ability and willingness to pick up new skills is paramount in what we're looking for. Get your hands dirty! <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">Here's a good place to start</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>To submit:</strong> Just zip up a copy of your code and email it to <a href="mailto:tech@newkind.com">tech@newkind.com</a>, or publish it wherever you like and send us a link. Please feel free to be as creative as you'd like with what you submit. Don't feel constrained by the styles/layout that I've built here. This is a great time to show off your design and development sensibilities and skills! We'll be accepting submissions until January 15.</p>

			<h2>General Questions</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>What do you hope to achieve through this internship?</br>
				 This internship will provide me training and experience I am looking for. As I do not have any professional experience, this internship will teach me how to work for an organisation and how to work with other people as a team. </li>
				<li>Are there particular skills or technologies you'd like to learn or work with?</br>
				I have experience working with Joomla, html, css. so I am looking forward to work with front end technologies.</li>
				<li>This internship will be a hybrid of 20% in-person and 80% remote, do you think you'll work well without regular support and oversight?</br>
				I am fast learner, so pretty confident that I can work with some guidance and no regular support and I can always get help from Google! if I am stuck anywhere.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Design Questions</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>Explain how design and development intersect. What role do you see a developer playing in the design process?</br>
				Web designer creates visual element and layout of the website and web developer turns that website design into a fully functioning website. Now, I feel a developer can provide design inputs as he/she goes about building the website. It could be suggestions to use a newer/better technology that could make the same design more relevant in the long run or suggesting modifications that could improve overall performance.  The function of a developer is to choose appropriate scripts and technologies to make the design provided by the web designer works. </li>
				
				<li>Describe how grids are useful, and how you generally go about using them, or implementing them.</br>
				Grids are very useful when you want your design to look more appealing. There are some fundamental design rules when it comes to implementing a grid. If the object or content is placed at the intersection of grid lines, the design will be more visually appealing. In other words, grid is like a framework in which designer can put different display elements in a rational but attractive way. My own website features a number of photographs and I like to use the grid principle in my photography as well!</li>
				
				<li>Talk a little bit about pattern libraries and visual systems. What are they and how are they useful? Have you used them before?</br>
				Pattern library is a collection of user interface design patterns or a collection of different visual elements like slide shows, navigations, new listing, related links etc. which appear multiple times in a website.<br> 
				Visual system sets the standards to the following elements of websites: typography, color, imagery, formats, logo and layouts. Designer has to set and follow some specific rules when it comes to visual systems.<br>
				I have never used pattern libraries before but I hope to learn it and use it in my future projects.</li>

			<h2>Technical Questions</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>Describe your experience developing for Wordpress. Go into detail, please.<br>
				Well, I have never worked with Wordpress, as I developed my website <a href="http://www.goodfoodseeker.com "> goodfoodseeker</a> in Joomla. But if any project demands Wordpress, I am sure I can learn it fast as both Joomla and Wordpress are PHP and mySQL based open source CMS</li>
				
				<li>Is this your first time using version control? If not, tell us about other times you've used it, and which technologies.<br>
				This is the first time I am using version control and I already liked it so far and looking forward to use it further.</li>
				
				<li>Do you have experience with CSS pre-processors? Which one do you prefer and why?</br>
				No, I have no experience with CSS pre-processors.</li>
			
				<li>What is your comfort level with responsive design? Have you done any mobile-first projects before? Tell us about what you know.</br>
				I have average knowledge about the responsive design just enough to make it work.<br>
				I have not done any mobile-first projects before. <br>
				Mobile-first project is a project in which you start gathering information, designing and developing a website on the basis of mobile version not desktop version. It is just the opposite of responsive design. You first begin with a website for a mobile version and then work your way up to the tablet and desktop version.</li>
				
				<li>What books or blogs do you like to read, people you follow on twitter, etc. to keep up with the latest trends in front-end development?</br>
				I follow joomla.org, stackoverflow.com, google developers, w3school.com, thenewboston.com to learn new language or framework or technology. YouTube is always a great resource.</li>
				
				<li>What tools, frameworks, etc. do you enjoy using? Tell us why.</br>
				I am very comfortable working with Joomla as I have first hand experience with it and there are so many free components and plugins in Joomla to work with. I also use google analytics, filezilla and google webmaster tools. I have extensively used Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques for my own website to improve organic page ranks. Worked with Google AdWords and Google AdSense.</li>
				
				<li>Explain how HTML, CSS, and JS interact - what is each layer responsible for?</br>
				HTML is a mark up language used for structuring the contents of a web page, so it provides structure. CSS is used for visual styles for every content of your web page, it provides styling and Java script is a client side scripting language which interacts with HTML structure and content, that means it is used for interactive functionality in response to a click or event. These technologies combine to provide a seamless user experience so the user can easily interact with content presented on the webpage.</li>
				
				<li>Progressive enhancement or graceful degredation? Choose your side.</br>
				I will definitely go with progressive enhancement because for any application or website, the ultimate goal is to achieve the basic rock solid functionality and basic user satisfaction or user experience and you can always add something extra for the user who has updated or modern browser or platform.	</li>

			<h2>What else?</h2>

			<p>Tell us more about yourself. What would you like for us to know? Feel free to tack on whatever you'd like here, build out a digital resume, or whatever! It's up to you!</br>

			Hello, I am Neha, a home maker, technologist and a foodie with an honorary Masters in Computer Applications degree and I fell in love with web development, when I first started building my own website. My website's name is <a href="http://www.goodfoodseeker.com "> goodfoodseeker</a> and it is food recipe blog. I publish my own recipes and share with the world! I went with building my own site and not use a blog platform because the technologist in me found that to be a challenge and a fun way. The first version I built using HTML/CSS which I upgraded to Joomla CMS for the many benefits. Your questionnaire has already taught me a lot, it took time to come up with the answers and a fun way to learn new things. So, I have to be thankful.
			I'm passionate about my work and always up to learn new skills.
